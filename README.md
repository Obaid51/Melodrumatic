## Overview
Melodrumatic is an audio plugin that lets you "pitch-shift" via delay (i.e. the Doppler effect) to turn unpitched audio into melodies. Controllable via MIDI or mouse :)

## Available Formats
VST3, AU, AAX

## Installation
Download the latest version of Melodrumatic from the [releases](https://github.com/usdivad/Melodrumatic/releases) page, then unzip and place the individual files into the appropriate plugin folders for your respective DAWs.

For Mac, this usually means:
```
VST3  -->  ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3
AU    -->  ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components
AAX   -->  /Library/Application Support/Avid/Audio/Plug-Ins
```

And for Windows, this usually means:
```
VST3  -->  C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3
AU    -->  Not supported :(
AAX   -->  C:\Program Files\Common Files\Avid\Audio\Plug-Ins
```

## Usage
*(NOTE: The screenshot examples are in Ableton Live, but the steps should be relatively similar for any DAW you use.)*

**1.** Insert Melodrumatic as an effect on the track whose output you'd like to pitch-shift (this can be either an audio or a MIDI track).

**2.** Create a MIDI track.

**3.** Route the MIDI track's output to the track that Melodrumatic resides on...

... and specifically to Melodrumatic.

**4.** (optional) If you have an external MIDI controller, assign that as the input to your MIDI track so that you can control Melodrumatic live!
